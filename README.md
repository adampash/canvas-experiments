canvas-experiments
==================

A series of experiments with the HTML5 canvas. These experiments include:

* Real-time image processing from the webcam (includes green-screen and other funky effects)
* Painting randomly generated polygons, evolving to match a source image as closely as possible.
* Skin detection

To give them a go, open the index.html file w/in the sub-directories. In some instances (like the polygon experiment) you'll need to run from some sort of localhost and not the filesystem (because of security sandboxing in the browser).

These are mostly tested with Chrome.
